# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data

The second project in Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program in PYTHON Udacity.

# Overview

In the last ten years, there has been a notable increase in both the number and popularity of bicycle-sharing systems in cities worldwide. These systems enable users to rent bicycles for short durations at a cost, facilitating convenient point-to-point travel. Users can borrow a bike from one location (point A) and return it to another (point B), although the option to return it to the same location is available for those looking to enjoy a leisurely ride. Regardless, a single bike can be utilized by multiple users within a day.

The proliferation of information technologies has greatly simplified the user experience within these systems, allowing individuals to easily access docking stations for bike unlocking and returns. These technological advancements have significantly enhanced the overall accessibility and efficiency of bicycle-sharing systems.
